# Advent of Code Solutions

## Description
This repository contains my Python solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenges. For each day, you will find both a Python script and an input file. Each year has verying levels of completion before the holidays got busy and had to put it to the side. One year I'll finish them all!

Fair warning, I started participating in these challenges while still in school, so please excuse the questionable code quality on older years...
