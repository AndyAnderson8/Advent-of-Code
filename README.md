# Advent of Code Solutions

## Description
This repository contains my Python solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenges. Each year's solutions are organized such that there is a separate directory for each day (numbered 1-31). For each day, you will find both a Python script and an input file.

## Installation and Setup
To run a specific solution, navigate to the year and day folder and execute the Python script. 

For example, to run the solution for Day 2 of year 2023:
```bash
cd 2023/2
python 2.py
```
